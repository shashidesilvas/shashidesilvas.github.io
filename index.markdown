Hi! My name is Shashini De Silva. I am a PhD candidate in the department of electrical engineering and computer science at Oregon State University, advised by [Prof. Jinsub Kim](https://sites.google.com/a/cornell.edu/jinsub-kim/home). I received my B.Sc. from [University of Moratuwa](http://www.ent.mrt.ac.lk/web3/), Sri Lanka in 2015 and my M.Sc. from [Oregon State University](https://eecs.oregonstate.edu/) in 2019. My background is in signal processing and machine learning where my research focus on securing power grid operations from adversarial perturbations.
