*Nov 2020* - Received NSF student travel grant for [IEEE SmartGridComm](https://sgc2020.ieee-smartgridcomm.org/) conference. Also served as a reviewer and a student volunteer in the conference.

*June 2020* - Completed Ph.D. preliminery exam with exceptional remarks.

*May 2020* - Presented our work on [Cost Aware Adversarial Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9053631) in [ICASSP-2020](https://2020.ieeeicassp.org/) (virtual event). (Video)

*Jan 2020* - Joined the OSU research team that works on [Bigdata, AI and ML Technology to Leverage Synchrophasor Measurements in Power Grids](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2019/04/f61/Big%20Data%20Awards%20Fact%20Sheet%20FINAL_1.pdf) in collaboration with Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories (SEL) and Department of Energy (DOE).  

*June 2019* - Participated in CREDC Summer symposium, which was held in Illinois, USA. It was a very interesting and an engaging week where I got the oppurtunity to meet the giants working towards cyber-resilient electric grid. 

*Dec 2018* - Succesfully completed the Ph.D. Qualifying exam and defended Master's thesis!   

*Nov 2018* - Presented our work on [Sparse Error Correction for PMU Data under GPS Spoofing Attacks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8645973) at [IEEE GlobalSIP](http://2018.ieeeglobalsip.org/Symposia.asp) conference held in Anaheim, California.

*Sep 2018* - Presented a poster on my research work at [2018 CREDC Industry Workshop](https://publish.illinois.edu/2018credciw/) held in MIT Samberg conference center, Massachusetts.

*June 2017* - Started working as a student researcher in [CREDC](https://cred-c.org/) on the project [Towards Attack Resilient Data Analytics for Power Grid Operations](https://cred-c.org/researchactivity/towards-attack-resilient-data-analytics-power-grid-operations). 

*Sep 2016* - Started my Ph.D. at Oregon State University.

*Dec 2015* - Presented my undergraduate research project on [A Sensor Platform for the Visually Impaired to Walk Straight Avoiding Obstacles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7438513) at the International Conference in Sensing Technology, held in University of Auckland, New Zealand.
